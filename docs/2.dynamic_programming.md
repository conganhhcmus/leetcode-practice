# Dynamic Programming (DP)

## Introduction
- DP (Dynamic Programming) is an optimization technique used to improve recursive solutions.
- It stores results of overlapping subproblems to avoid redundant computations.
- This reduces time complexity from exponential to polynomial in many cases.

### Example: Fibonacci Sequence
- Fibonacci: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, ...
- Recursive formula: `Fibo(n) = Fibo(n-1) + Fibo(n-2)`
```csharp
int Fibonaci(int n){
    if (n <= 1) return n;
    return Fibonaci(n-1) + Fibonaci(n-2);
}
```
- Problem: `Fibo(n-2)` is recalculated multiple times when computing `Fibo(n)` and `Fibo(n-1)`.
- Solution: Store `Fibo(n-2)` once and reuse it — this is the core idea of DP!

## Steps to Solve a Dynamic Programming Problem
1. **Identify** if the problem has overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure.
2. **Decide the state** — define what each state represents using the fewest parameters.
3. **Formulate the state transition** — figure out how to build the current state using previous states.
4. **Choose an approach** — use Memoization (top-down) or Tabulation (bottom-up) to implement the solution.

## Ways to Implement DP
### Memoization
- Top-down approach
- Stores the results of function calls in a table.
- Recursive implementation
- Entries are filled when needed.
  
```csharp
int[] memo = new int[1000];
Array.Fill(memo, - 1);

int Fibonaci(int n){
    if (n <= 1) return n;
    if (memo[n] != -1) return memo[n];
    int ret = Fibonaci(n-1) + Fibonaci(n-2);
    memo[n] = ret;
    return ret;
}
```
### Tabulation
- Bottom-up approach
- Stores the results of subproblems in a table
- Iterative implementation
- Entries are filled in a bottom-up manner from the smallest size to the final size.

```csharp
int Fibonaci(int n){
    if (n <= 1) return n;

    int[] dp = new int[n+1];
    dp[0] = 0;
    dp[1] = 1;
    for(int i = 2;i <= n; ++i){
        dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2];
    }
    return dp[n];
}
```

```csharp
// optimize space
// we see that only need the last two values at each step
int Fibonaci(int n){
    if (n <= 1) return n;
    // dp1 = dp[i-1], dp2 = dp[i-2]
    int dp1 = 1, dp2 = 0;
    int ret = 0;
    for(int i = 2;i <= n; ++i){
        ret = dp1 + dp2;
        dp2 = dp1;
        dp1 = ret;
    }
    return ret;
}
```

| Feature                   | Memoization (Top-Down)                                             | Tabulation (Bottom-Up)                         |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **State**                 | State transition is easy to think from recursion                   | State transition is harder to define up front  |
| **Code**                  | Easy to write by modifying the recursive solution                  | Can get complicated with many conditions       |
| **Speed**                 | Slower due to recursion overhead                                   | Faster — avoids recursion                      |
| **Subproblem Solving**    | Solves only the subproblems that are needed                        | Solves all subproblems regardless of need      |
| **Table Entries**         | Fills entries on demand                                            | Fills all entries in order                     |
| **Memory Initialization** | Initialize `memo[]` with -1 to mark uncomputed states              | Initialize `dp[]` with base values (like 0, 1) |
| **Solution Direction**    | Starts from `n` and breaks down recursively to smaller subproblems | Builds up from smallest subproblem to `n`      |
| **Handling Base Cases**   | Handled with conditionals inside the recursive function            | Pre-filled during table initialization         |
| **Space Usage**           | Extra space for recursion stack (up to `O(n)` in worst case)       | Only needs a DP array (`O(n)` space)           |

## DP Concepts
### Standard DP
```text
You are climbing a staircase. It takes n steps to reach the top. Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?  

Example 1:  
Input: n = 2  
Output: 2  
Explanation: There are two ways to climb to the top.  
1. 1 step + 1 step  
2. 2 steps  
Example 2:  
 
Input: n = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: There are three ways to climb to the top.
1. 1 step + 1 step + 1 step
2. 1 step + 2 steps
3. 2 steps + 1 step

Constraints:

1 <= n <= 45
```

```csharp
public int ClimbStairs(int n)
{
    // f[i]: number of way can to climb to i
    // f[0] = 1
    // f[1] = 1
    // f[i] = f[i-1] + f[i-2]
    int[] f = new int[n + 1];
    f[0] = f[1] = 1;
    for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++)
    {
        f[i] = f[i - 1] + f[i - 2];
    }
    return f[n];
}
```

### Bitmasking DP

- Use a **bitmask** to represent the state — often used when the problem involves **subsets**, **visited states**, or **combinations** (e.g., permutations, Traveling Salesman Problem).
- Each bit in the mask indicates whether a certain element is included or visited.
- Typical DP form:  
  `dp[mask][i]` → represents the minimum cost or number of ways to reach state `mask` ending at element `i`.

```csharp
// Example idea:
// dp[mask][i] = minimum cost to reach node i with visited mask `mask`
int[,] dp = new int[1 << n, n];
```

### Digit DP
- Digit DP is used when counting numbers with certain properties within a given range (e.g., count numbers $\le N$ where digits satisfy a condition).

- State often involves:

  `index`: the current digit position being considered (from left to right).
  
  `tight`: a boolean flag indicating if the number formed so far is strictly less than the prefix of the given number N. If tight is true, the current digit can be any digit from 0 to 9. If tight is false, the current digit can only go up to the digit at the current index in N.

  `leadingZeros`: a boolean flag indicating if the number formed so far has leading zeros. This is important when the problem has constraints on the first digit or when counting numbers without leading zeros.
  
  `...`: additional flags or values based on the specific problem constraints (e.g., count of a particular digit, sum of digits modulo a value).
```csharp
// Example idea: Counting numbers with no consecutive identical digits up to N
// dp[index][tight][prevDigit] = number of valid numbers formed from index to the end
// tight: boolean, true if the current prefix matches the prefix of N, false otherwise
// prevDigit: the previous digit placed
