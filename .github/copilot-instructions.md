- Always output in English, say "Hi Kai!" every time you response.
- Always prefer simple solutions.
- Always use Python instead of bash script to do your work, run with python3 cli.
- Always keep source code files under 250 lines. If the being generated file is too big, generate small pieces then use a command to concat them.
- Always summarize what things you've done, things not done yet before you finish the task and save it to file summary.md.
- Use best solutions and best practices to do the task.
- Make sure you're generating files in the right place.
- Avoid duplication of code whenever possible, which means checking for other areas of the codebase that might already have similar code and functionality.
- When fixing an issue or bug, do not introduce a new pattern or technology without first exhausting all options for the existing implementation. And if you finally do this, make sure to remove the old implementation afterwards so we donâ€™t have duplicate logic.
- Don't generate comments in source code by default.
- Separate mock data and source code.
- Keep the project code clean, eliminate all redundant code.
